    Comments: There are three types of comments in Java.

    The first is called a single-line comment A single-line comment begins with two slashes. Anything you type after
    that on the same line is ignored by the compiler:

    // comment until end of line

    Next comes the multiple-line comment. A multiple-line comment (also known as a multiline comment) includes anything
    starting from the symbol /* until the symbol * / . People often type an asterisk ( * ) at the beginning of each line
    of a multiline comment to make it easier to read, but you donâ€™t have to:

    /* Multiple
    * line comment
    * /

    Finally, we have a Javadoc comment, This comment is similar to a multiline comment except it starts with /** .
    This special syntax tells the Javadoc tool to pay attention to the comment. Javadoc comments have a specific
    structure that the Javadoc tool knows how to read:

    /**
    * Javadoc multiple-line comment
    * @author Jeanne and Scott
    * /
