        A Java program begins execution with its main() method. A main() method is the
        gateway between the startup of a Java process, which is managed by the Java Virtual
        Machine (JVM), and the beginning of the programmerâ€™s code. The JVM calls on the
        underlying system to allocate memory and CPU time, access fi les, and so on.

        In practice, you can write String[] args , String args[] or String...
        args; the compiler accepts any of these. The variable name args hints that this list contains
        values that were read in (arguments) when the JVM started. You can use any name you like,
        though. The characters [] are brackets and represent an array. An array is a fixed-size list of
        items that are all of the same type. The characters ... are called varargs (variable argument
        lists)
